# Greetings!
I am a Computer Engineering student at Western University. Some of my interests are embedded systems, electronics, computer architecture, low level programming, robotics and computer graphics. However, I enjoy learning about other fields of development and strive to have a wide variety of skills.

# Projects
## NES Emulator
Work in progress NES emulator built with C++ and Dear ImGui. I currently have a functional 6502 CPU implementation and am working through the PPU. I have also built several debugging tools along the way to aid with testing and troubleshooting.

## Multi-user, Multi-transaction Server (Pixelnary)
Multithreaded server implementation to host games of a pictionary style game. The server supports having multiple rooms, each with multiple concurrent players. The server can handle multiple cases of events, such as players leaving or disconnecting and joining late. The server is implemented in C++ using the Asio library and has been tested on both Windows and Linux. The client is written in Python using the Tkinter library. This was developed along with a team of students as a stretch project for my operating systems course (SE 3313 at Western University).

## Software 3D Renderer
A basic 3D render written in Java. It is able to read object files and has some primitive lighting and camera control.
